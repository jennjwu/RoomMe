Steps:

1) Create a database called “roomme” on your localhost.
2) Use the sql file to create tables and populate with our data.
3) Foreign key checks already set. No need to worry about it.
4) Check that the tables and data are there.

If you make changes to DB schema, please let everyone know so we all operate using the same database.
